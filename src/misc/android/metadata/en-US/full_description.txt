Open Surge Engine is a valuable tool for learning game development, programming, artistic skills, and the nature of free and open-source software in a playful way.

Note: the PC edition of the engine has more editing capabilities than the mobile edition, but Surge the Rabbit can be played on both. Android TV users need a gamepad to play and a mouse to use the editor.
